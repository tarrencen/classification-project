### classification-project
This repository holds the work for my Codeup Data Science (Innis Cohort) ML Classification project.

The goal for this project is to build an ML model that will predict churn in the Telco telecommunication company's customer base. A report of this model's findings, including (but not limited to) recommendations to reduce churn,  will be presented to stakeholders in the company's business leadership.

Initial analytical exploration of the data indicates that a driver of churn may be dissatisfaction with either price or service among customers who used Telco's fiber internet service. 70% of customers who churned (1297 of 1869) were fiber internet subscribers. 52% of these churned customers streamed TV or movies.
