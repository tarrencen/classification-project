### classification-project
This repository holds the work for my Codeup Data Science (Innis Cohort) ML Classification project.

# The goal for this project is to build an ML model that will predict churn in the Telco telecommunication company's customer base. A report of this model's findings, including (but not limited to) recommendations to reduce churn,  will be presented to stakeholders in the company's business leadership.
